 Pharma stocks on a high, Happiest slips; 139 stocks flash buy signals


Pharma stocks continued their rally on Friday with many of the stocks hitting their 52-week highs, while the benchmark indices developed cold feet and logged small losses. Nifty ended up forming Bearish Belt Hold pattern in signs that the recent rally may be losing steam.

Among stock-specific action, Happiest Minds Technologies NSE -3.30 %, which had had a dream debut on Thursday, edged lower as investors locked in some gains. Essel Propack dropped after an ET report that Blackstone would sell about 23 per cent stake in the company at a discount to Thursday’s market price.

Next week, three back-t0-back IPOs will dominate the market action as Computer Age Management Services (CAMS), Chemcon Specialty Chemicals and Angel Broking hit the market.

“Due to lack of fresh triggers, the current uncertainty is expected to continue. But any news with regard to the border standoff with China or global events can impact the markets on the downside. Investors need to be cautious and watch news-specific movements,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

That said, here is a lowdown on what happened in Friday’s trade:
